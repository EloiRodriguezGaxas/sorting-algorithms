# Sorting Algorithms #

This project is a web-page visualizer of different types of sorting algorithms. It recreates the algorithms bubble sort, heap sort, merge sort and quicksort.

The demo is accessible [here](https://eloirodriguezgaxas.github.io/sorting-algorithms/).

You can select the algorithm, the array size and the speed of the animation.

The algorithms are **NOT OPTIMAL!** The algorithms are prepared for illustrating how they work but they are not developed for performance, only for teaching/demonstrating matters.
